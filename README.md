A Discord bot to play around with.

Run `npm install` to install required dependencies.
Optionally run `npm audit fix` to bring dependencies up to date.

Run `node index.js` to run.

To create a new command, create a new file in the commands directory.
`ping.js` and `echo.js` are there to serve as examples.
